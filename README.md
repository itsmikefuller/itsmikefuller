I am a Technology & Transformation Consultant in the Capital Markets Group at Deloitte, a team of quants and tech specialists responsible for R&D of the firm's economic scenario generator (ESG) solution.

I have 4 years of professional experience in Financial Services, with software consulting experience spanning across the Banking, Insurance, and Capital Markets sectors. This includes multiple engagements as a Python developer for hyperexponential's insurance pricing platform, hx Renew. In October 2024, I became a certified [Core Model Developer](https://www.credential.net/5b868f2f-4a8f-462b-af85-7e850b7d75d8#acc.x6gNLjHe) of the Renew platform. Through client projects I have gained first-hand experience in project management and stakeholder management, having led workshops and provided mentorship to members of my team on multiple engagements.

Outside of client work, I am a lead developer and researcher for the Deloitte ESG team. I regularly review and mentor junior developers in the team, ensuring that clean, maintainable, and scalable code is produced in line with best practices.

I previously worked as a decision modelling analyst at Nationwide Building Society, and hold a 1st class Master's degree in Mathematics and quantitative research experience from the University of Oxford.
